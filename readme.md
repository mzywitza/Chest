# Monastry.Chest #

This the Monastry.Chest project. This project's goal is to allow me diving into GUI programming with WPF and the RavenDB document database. Besides, I'm looking for a replacement for MoneyManagerEx, which is a cool software but lacks some important features for me.

## The technical details ##

Here's the summary

- GitFlow
- WPF
- RavenDB embedded
- Caliburn.Micro
- to be continued...
